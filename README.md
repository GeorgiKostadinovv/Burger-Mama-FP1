PROJECT TITLE

Burger Mama Website

DESCRIPTION

This project is entirely writen with HTML and CSS. The restaurant spirit is about quality over quantity and I wanted to 
relfect that within the project (at least esteticly). My professional background is centered in hospitality (now everyone can understand why I am trying to change my career...) and my last year was focused on opening a small restaurant, just a few tables, only using high quality product and that was obviusly relfected in the price. With that kind of prices everything has to be perfect or almost perfect...and it was, at least when we talk about food. The whole year I was moaning about some technical problems we had with our take away platforms and the simplicity of our menu descriptions and utilities, among others. With my current skills I am still not able to convert my ideas in code but in the future and when I gain more knowledge I will continue developing this project. What I wanted to show to potential people who will visit the website are very good pictures of the menu with not necesaly big descriptions and focused on the colors, we all know people eat with their eyes, and I think I managed to do it.

PROBLEMS

Had a few problems while coding, mainly solved following the institue instructions or checking in Internet,  but with a hand on my heart I can say most of them would be avoided if I organised myself better and didn`t rush at the end....of course. The following two got me just a little bit desperate and because of the time I had to solve them other way.

Goole maps link: My plan was to create to columns, on the left side a table with opening hours and on the right, the google link. The problem was that the div ate the footer so at the end the browser was putting together both elements and the last one was only visible on the left site where the link was. I need to reserch more. Another problem is related to VPN extension in the browser, if that condition is true, the link may not load properly.

Responsive allergen list (table): It looks more or less how I wanted but under 400 px stops shrinking. I am not entirely happy with the final result but I have to investigate more and improve it!
